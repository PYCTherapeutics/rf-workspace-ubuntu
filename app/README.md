## Calculating the distance between sulfhdryl groups

### Introduction

A disulfide bond is formed from the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups between two Cystein side chains and resulting a covalent bond.

A sulfhydryl group contains the –SH functional group and is also known as a thiol. The disulfide bond is formed in the presence of an electron acceptor 2e- that removes 2H+ in the following reaction:

R-SH + SH-R <-> R-S-S-R + 2H+ +2e-

Sun et al 2017 states that disulfide bonds are usually about 2.05 Å in length, and 3.0 Å is taken as the cut-off for disulfides in the PDB database. Other work by Bhattacharyya et al 2004 looked at disulfide bonds that were identified using a cut-off distance of 2.3 Å between the Sγ atoms of two Cys residues.

Here we process PDB files of cyclic peptides and calculate the distance between sulfhydryl groups to establish whether they are close enough for disulfide bond formation.
